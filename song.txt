A taste of honey...tasting much sweeter than wine.

I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine
A taste of honey...tasting much sweeter than wine.


I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again

Hi! We shell overcome!


The man is fool, when it is hot
It wants be cool 
When it is cool
It wats be hoot
He always want 

That he have not
He always want 
That he have not

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine
A smelt of money...tasting much sweeter than wine.

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart
That taste of honeyâ€¦tasting much sweeter than wine
